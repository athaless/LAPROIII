# LAPROIII

This is a repository with old programs developed in the discipline of Programming Laboratory III (LAPROIII) studied at PUC-RS, in the 90s, with professor MÃ¡rcio S. Pinho.

The course was focused on programming Language ASSEMBLY 80386 and C.

# Three works were requested and developed at the time:

1) A text editor (something equivalent to the old DOS Edit) that supports at least four pages, mouse and some basic functions for saving, etc.

2) A file compactor with the least amount of code possible and according to the content seen so far.

3) A simplified "resident" program (study on virus architecture)
